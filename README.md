# Nios II Development with CPUlator Simulator on the Altera DE2-115 FPGA

### INSAT IIA3

**Technologies:** CPUlator, Nios II, HDL, Altera DE2-115, Cyclone IV E FPGA, PLD, Digital Logic Design

## Introduction

This project delves into the realm of FPGA and softcore processors, focusing on understanding design principles and hardware description languages (HDL). With a keen focus on the Nios II processor family, our collaboration aimed to explore specifications, performance benchmarks, and development methodologies.

## Project Scope

Executed between April 13, 2022, and April 28, 2022, this project was undertaken during the second semester of my 3rd year of Industrial Computing and Automation (IIA3) at INSAT to validate the subject "Real-time Operating Systems". It involved meticulous research, analysis, and practical implementation. 

## Technical Details

- **CPUlator Simulator Integration**: Leveraged the web-based CPUlator simulator to execute Nios II assembly programs, providing enhanced system state visibility and practical simulation capabilities.
- **7-Segment Display Program**: Developed a CPUlator program for dynamically rotating a number on the DE2 board's 7-segment displays, serving educational purposes.
- **VGA Functionality Testing**: Conducted comprehensive functionality testing of the Altera DE2-115 board's VGA using CPUlator, assessing performance accuracy by cycling through a color spectrum.
- **LED Control Assembly Programs**: Implemented assembly programs on CPUlator to simulate a green LED train and synchronize the activation of red LEDs in even and odd positions, fostering a deeper understanding of digital logic.
