# Nios II Development with CPUlator Simulator on the Altera DE2-115 FPGA

### INSAT IIA3

**Technologies:** CPUlator, Nios II, HDL, Altera DE2-115, Cyclone IV E FPGA, PLD, Digital Logic Design

## Introduction

This project undertaken during the 3rd year of Industrial Computing and Automation (IIA3) in INSAT for the subject "Real-time Operating Systems" delves into the realm of FPGA and softcore processors, focusing on understanding design principles and hardware description languages (HDL). With a keen focus on the Nios II processor family, our collaboration aimed to explore specifications, performance benchmarks, and development methodologies.

## Project Scope

Executed between April 13, 2022, and April 28, 2022, this project involved meticulous research, analysis, and practical implementation. The selection of the Altera DE2-115 development board equipped with the Cyclone IV E device facilitated efficient digital logic design with its robust capabilities and cost-effectiveness.

## Technical Details

- **CPUlator Simulator Integration**: Leveraged the web-based CPUlator simulator to execute Nios II assembly programs, providing enhanced system state visibility and practical simulation capabilities.
- **7-Segment Display Program**: Developed a CPUlator program for dynamically rotating a number on the DE2 board's 7-segment displays, serving educational purposes.
- **VGA Functionality Testing**: Conducted comprehensive functionality testing of the DE2-115 board's VGA using CPUlator, assessing performance accuracy by cycling through a color spectrum.
- **LED Control Assembly Programs**: Implemented assembly programs on CPUlator to simulate a green LED train and synchronize the activation of red LEDs in even and odd positions, fostering a deeper understanding of digital logic.
